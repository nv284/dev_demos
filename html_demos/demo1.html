        Birds are feathered theropod <em>dinosaurs and constitute</em> the only known living dinosaurs. Likewise, birds are considered reptiles in the modern cladistic sense of the term, and their closest living relatives are the crocodilians.

      <h2><u>Evolution and classification</u></h2>   
      <pre>The first classification of birds was developed by Francis Willughby and John Ray in their 1676 volume Ornithologiae.[8] Carl Linnaeus modified that work in 1758 to devise the taxonomic classification system currently in use.[9] Birds are categorised as the biological class Aves in Linnaean taxonomy. Phylogenetic taxonomy places Aves in the clade Theropoda</pre>
